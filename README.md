# CodSoft Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to the CodSoft Data Science Internship Projects repository. This collection showcases various data science and machine learning tasks completed during the internship, each designed to enhance skills in data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Projects

### Titanic Survival Prediction
This project involves predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using classification techniques. Key features such as age, gender, and passenger class are analyzed to determine survival probabilities. The project employs models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to classify whether a passenger survived or not.

### Movie Rating Prediction
This project focuses on estimating movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and budget. Using regression models like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, the project demonstrates how to predict continuous outcomes from various input features.

### Iris Flower Classification
In this project, classification algorithms are used to categorize Iris flower species into one of three classes: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. Techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied to the Iris dataset to achieve high classification accuracy.

### Sales Prediction Using Python
This project involves forecasting future sales based on historical data and factors such as advertising expenditure. Regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression and Time Series Analysis, are employed to predict sales trends and inform business decisions.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using anomaly detection techniques. The dataset includes features related to credit card transactions, and models such as Isolation Forest and Autoencoders are used to detect anomalies. Performance is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure effective fraud detection.
